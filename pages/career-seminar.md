## Career Seminar
In our frequently changing economy, a liberal arts degree has never been more valuable. This one-credit seminar (CLA 1002) will focus on the flexibility of a liberal arts degree and will prepare students to pursue careers in various industries, including government, non-profit, corporate, education, etc. Upon successful completion of this course, students will have developed the skills necessary to effectively search for career opportunities and communicate professionally.

Students will also develop an application-ready resume and will be well-prepared for networking and professional interviews. The mission of the Career Seminar is to guide students as they explore the value of their liberal arts degree, capitalize on current opportunities, and equip students with the tools to confidently market themselves to potential employers. Beginning in the fall of 2016, the course is required of all new students within the College of Liberal Arts.
